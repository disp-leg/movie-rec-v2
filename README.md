# Movie Rec v2

Curated movie recommendations based on [The Divide (2011)](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-divide-2011/). 26 deep-cut survival, isolation, and psychological horror films sourced from Reddit, Letterboxd, horror TikTok, YouTube, X, and blogs.

## Architecture

### UI Structure

Single-page continuous scroll with five sections:

1. **Hero** — Full-bleed featured movie poster with dark gradient overlay, title, tagline
2. **Featured Pick** — The top recommendation with large poster, full description, Letterboxd quotes
3. **Category Rows** — Horizontal scroll rows grouped by theme (Survival, Bunker, Psychological, Post-Apocalyptic, Confined, Group Dynamics). App Store / Apple TV style.
4. **Full Collection** — All 26 films as a vertical list with thumbnail posters. Tap to expand inline detail view with description, reviews, streaming info, and actions.
5. **Footer** — Attribution

### Behavior Engine

`src/lib/behavior.ts` + `src/hooks/useBehavior.ts`

Tracks user signals per movie via localStorage:

| Signal | Effect on Score |
|--------|----------------|
| **Save** | +50 |
| **Expand** (tap to read) | +10 per expand (max +30) |
| **Skip** ("Not for me") | -100 (drops to bottom, still visible) |
| **Seen** ("Already seen") | -200 (filtered out entirely) |

Additional scoring:

- **DNA similarity boost:** +20 for each DNA tag shared with any saved movie. If you save a bunker film, other bunker films rise.
- **Freshness boost:** +30 for movies added in the last 7 days.
- **Tie-breaking:** Rating descending.

Skipped movies can be un-skipped. Seen movies are hidden. State persists in localStorage under `movie-rec-behavior`.

On first visit, all movies display in the curated order from `data/movies.json` (base score 100).

### Content Pipeline

Movies are sourced from real human recommendations, not algorithms.

**Sources searched:**
- Reddit: r/horror, r/moviesuggestions, r/TrueFilm, r/obscuremedia
- Letterboxd: lists, similar films, reviews
- Horror TikTok, YouTube channels, X/Film Twitter
- Horror blogs: HorrorNews.net, Bloody Disgusting, Scariest Things, Creepy Catalog
- IMDB curated lists

**Constraints (every movie must pass):**
- Released 2000 or later
- English audio (original language, not dubbed)
- Deep cut — not surfaced by a casual Google search, no A-list leads with wide theatrical release
- Shares at least 2 DNA traits with The Divide: survival, isolation, claustrophobia, post-apocalyptic, psychological horror, bleak tone, bunker/confined setting, group dynamics, societal collapse, power dynamics

**Validation:** Two-pass automated validation (Data Validator agent) checks year, language, mainstream visibility, thematic DNA match, and data completeness. Films that fail are removed.

**User filter:** Cross-referenced against Letterboxd user Riamont's watched list (scraped via pagination). Any film she's already seen is excluded.

**Each movie entry includes:**
- Title, year, director, rating
- Genre tags and DNA tags
- Description explaining specifically why it's similar to The Divide
- Letterboxd quotes (top positive + top negative review)
- Streaming availability (SVOD, VOD, free platforms)
- Source URLs for attribution
- TMDB poster path

### Poster Images

Poster paths are stored in `data/movies.json` as `posterPath` fields. The `src/lib/posters.ts` module builds full TMDB URLs:

```
https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/{posterPath}
```

`MoviePoster` component handles rendering with a gradient fallback when no poster is available.
